    <h1>This is my practice page</h1>
    <h2>This is my first paragraph</h2>
    <p>Welcome to my practice webpage. This website actually won't make any
    sense because there is no specific content I want to create on this page.
    <br />
    In this paragraph I will demonstrate the use of <b>bold</b> to
    emphasize important text. Another thing you can use is <i>italics</i>.
    <br />
    This is likely your 1<sup>st</sup> time visiting the site.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>learn how to set everything up</li>
      <li>integrate every single element and attribute</li>
      <li>become confident with html</li>
      <li>may something that resembles the website</li>
    </ol>
